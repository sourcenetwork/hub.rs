# Bulletin collection queries

Collection queries return complete results only within their work budget:

- At most 128 inspected records.
- At most 1 MiB of inspected storage keys and encoded record values.
- A selection prefix no longer than 64 KiB.
- For glob queries, a pattern no longer than 4 KiB.

The same collector serves namespace lists, namespace collaborators, namespace
posts, all posts and glob-selected posts. Nonmatching glob records count against
the inspection budget. Oversized queries return an explicit error; partial
results are never returned as complete. Malformed records and record/key
mismatches also return errors instead of being skipped.

For larger collections, use `HubClient::list_bulletin_namespaces`,
`list_bulletin_posts` or `list_bulletin_collaborators`. These existing native APIs
verify certified prefix pages and return continuation cursors. Apply any glob
filter to each verified post page locally. Each page has its own selected
revision; pagination does not pin a historical snapshot.

Globs retain literal matching with `*` spanning any sequence, including `/`.
Matching uses anchored prefix/suffix checks and forward searches for literal
segments, with no recursive backtracking. No other wildcard syntax is interpreted.

These read limits do not cap stored history or establish a measured execution
throughput target. Transport response limits apply separately from stored-byte
inspection limits.

Native startup and snapshot recovery validate complete bulletin records before
publishing query state. Truncated or trailing record bytes, namespace/post/
collaborator key mismatches, invalid policy-ID encoding and malformed parameters
stop restoration with a storage error. Absent settings remain valid for an
uninitialized module. Recovery does not repair or discard corrupt records.

`HubClient::read_bulletin_policy_id` authenticates the bulletin's ACP policy ID
against caller-provided consensus trust. Before the first namespace initializes
the policy, it returns certified absence. Present IDs must be canonical 64-byte
lowercase hexadecimal strings and are returned as 32-byte values. Use
`read_policy` with that ID and at least the returned revision to inspect the
policy definition. The two reads may select different finalized revisions;
policy presence does not itself grant permission to create posts or manage
collaborators.

Bulletin policy initialization distinguishes absence from invalid stored IDs.
Empty or non-UTF-8 values return errors before creating an ACP policy or changing
bulletin state. Posting and collaborator management use the same fallible reader.
Bulletin and core parameter reads also return decoding errors for corrupt stored
bytes; defaults apply only to missing keys. Native recovery checks these values
before publishing query state.

Namespace registration, posting, and collaborator changes reject empty namespace names before reading or mutating policy state. Failed empty-name registration does not initialize the bulletin policy.

Namespace inputs accept short names (`team`) and stored IDs (`bulletin/team`).
Registration results can be passed directly to subsequent reads, posting, and
collaborator changes. Both forms select the same namespace and authorization
object; an already prefixed ID is preserved. Verified client reads use the same
normalization and enforce limits on the resulting storage key.
